- Q Network Policies

How would you implement network security in Kubernetes to control the communication between namespaces or restrict access to certain services?


- Q Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

When and why would you use a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) in Kubernetes? Can you describe a scenario where a CRD would be beneficial?



- Q Multi-Cluster and Cross-Cluster Management

How would you manage an application deployment that spans multiple Kubernetes clusters? What considerations should you have for networking and consistency?



- Q Application Monitoring and Logging

What are some of the best practices for monitoring and logging in Kubernetes? How would you set up observability for applications running on a cluster?

- Q Handling Node Failures

How does Kubernetes handle node failures, and how would you ensure high availability for critical applications in case of node downtime?

- Q Stateful Applications and StatefulSets

Describe a scenario where you would use a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment. What makes StatefulSets suitable for certain applications?


- Q Ingress Configuration

How would you expose a web application to external users in Kubernetes? What are the main options for configuring an Ingress?


- Q Pod Resource Management

How would you ensure that a pod doesn’t use more resources than allocated? Describe how resource requests and limits work in Kubernetes.

# Cluster Management and Architecture
